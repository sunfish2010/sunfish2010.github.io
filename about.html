  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Yu, a software engineer working in the self-driving industry. In my spare time you can usually find me climbing, reading or creating some kind of art.
    This blog serves as a medium for me to document and share my ideas.

  <h1>Why the name?</h1>
  <p> 

  	Many of my friends call me by fish because my name has the same pronunciation as "fish" in Chinese. One day I bumped into a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMyA_a5rSU&feature=youtu.be">video</a> on youtube titled "my room becomes the sea". It resonates with me really well as I can see myself floating in the sea of memories lying on my bed every night before I go to sleep for a daily reflection. To me, each memory is similar to a small world behind the glasses in the aquarium. I can feel them, but not touch them. I can visit them multiple times a day, but I can never get inside. I can even share with friends and invite them to take a look, which is precisely what I hope this blog can serve as: a medium for me to record and share my ideas and experiences.
