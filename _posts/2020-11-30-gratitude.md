Several days before Thanksgiving while I was driving, I turned on my podcast as usual. Hidden Brain's *[Where gratitude gets you](https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/where-gratitude-gets-you/)* happened to be on top of the list. The episode resonated with me. Even though I have only been keeping a gratitude journal for about 3 months, I was amazed by how powerful writing down what I am grateful for is. And it doesn't even need to be a daily journal. I only write when I can remember, and it might be a little insensitive to say so during this challenging time, but my average happiness level was nearly at its peak during the past 3 months since 2018.

It is not that I no longer get upset. I still get stressed, and have many self-doubts here and there. The difference is that I can bounce back and control my emotions much better. Mostly because I have realized that emotions and feelings are temporary, and every entry I wrote down on the journal reminds me there are so many beautiful things I already have. Happiness is a choice; whether you can feel it depends on how you perceive the world. A little cliche but, the best thing in life, they are free. :)

In the podcast, they also mentioned how gratitude can help people delay instant gratification, as it shifts our focus back to who we want to become in the long term and motivates us to be better human beings. What's more, the power of gratitude extends beyond self-improvement. It is a somewhat contagious feeling that makes us want to give back and spread acts of kindness to others. 

For long, I have no special emotional attachments to Thanksgiving as it's a holiday that I didn't celebrate growing up. And mostly it had been a synonym for people to enjoy time with family members (while I have no family members in the States), satisfy their yearnings for materialistic goods (which I have some but not too strong), or satiate their appetites (which I am fond of). But now I see it as an opportunity to express my gratitude to others (Yes, I did write down what I am grateful for, but I still need to express them more.), and a reminder to stay humble. Anyone can be my teacher, and I undoubtedly cannot become who I am today without the people I had met in my life, whether it's 'good' or 'bad' encounters.

Have you sent any "thank you" letters in the past couple days? What's the last time you felt grateful for anything?

To my friends,

有些人 就像星星 看似很近 实际很远
那光却始终可以照进我心里

在我对人性快要失去希望的时候提醒我

不要放弃
给我以勇气

虽然人生注定是场孤独的旅行
但一路上哪怕是一样的风景
透过不同的人
也可以成像出如万花筒般的多彩

所以
不要停止探索
不要停止希望
热爱她
拥抱她


Some people, they’re like stars. 
They are close, and they are far.
But the light can always shine through me, 
And reminds me that I shall never give up.

Though life can only be a journey of one’s own.
With the same scene we interpret it differently.
Like staring into a Kaleidoscope, with every twist you get a fresh pattern. 

Therefore, 
Never stop exploring,
Never lose your curiosity.
Love her.
Embrace her.

感谢遇见你们，无论你们现在身处何方。
