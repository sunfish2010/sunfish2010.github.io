Personally, this book is quite similar to Atomic Habits in terms of its content. Most people think that the secret to success is willpower, but it is more about mindset and habits. In the book Atomic Habits, the author talks more about forming constructional habits and discontinuing ones not serving one’s goals. For example, to quit something, you can make it less attractive and less accessible. I like this book better because the author mentioned the following ideas:

* We should own 100% for everything we experience. <br/> <br/>
I interpret this as holding the power of controlling our lives in our own hands. This means when something “bad” happens, we look inward and find if there are things that we can do to solve the problem rather than complaining, pointing fingers, or expecting others to fix the problem. It is only when we no longer see ourselves as victims; we can regain the power back. Otherwise, we’ll always think there’s nothing we can do to change the situation. How can we possibly find a solution when our brains are not even seeking one? <br/><br/>
Of course, people would say, I didn’t choose to be robbed or hit by that pot falling from the building (I’m just using random examples here). Yes, nobody wants to experience pain, and I understand that. I don’t remember how many times I have asked myself this question: “Why me? What have I done that I need to experience all these pains?”. What I’m about to say might be a little controversial, but I found shifting my perspective that way helps me feel stronger. <br/><br/>
For something that has already happened, there is nothing we can do to change its outcome. But there are things we can do to prevent it from happening. For the example I mentioned above, we can avoid walking in shady areas late at night. We can prepare a small amount of cash to prevent things worse from happening. At the bigger picture, we can think about the root cause of the problem. Are the problems caused by an unfair distribution of wealth or an unhealthy societal structure? What are the things that we can do to help make things better? <br/><br/>
It may feel that as an individual, there is little we can do. However, if we consider that the world population living in extreme poverty has halved over the past twenty years and that in just over 100 hundred years ago, women were still unable to attend school. We can see that the world is becoming a better place. Behind the scenes, numerous individuals are working hard to make these positive changes. Even though there is really “nothing” we can do, we can at least stop blaming, immersing ourselves in these emotions, or ranting to people who do not welcome those emotions. (Note: This is not to say we shall suppress negative emotions. They have their values, but in my opinion, negative emotions work like a lighthouse. They help us identify things we care.) 

* The author mentions how we can increase our awareness by tracking. <br/><br/>
Most people, including myself are not aware of the motivations behind their behaviors and decision process. If I reflect on my actions, I notice that traditional values and culture often influence my choices. But I rarely deliberate on my reasoning process. The only thing I notice is that I feel uncomfortable or even painful even I was making the “right” choices. I will not take it further regarding what is right and what is wrong because that would probably take another article. The takeaway here is that we should try to stay aware as much as possible and practice observing ourselves from a third-party perspective so that we can discover what the things truly important for us are and what are the things that don’t serve us. That way, we can become more grateful and focus on the things we already have. 

* Focus on what you have gained instead of what you have lost while making a change. <br/><br/>
It is not hard to understand this point since the critical part of change is to create a positive feedback loop. If a person concentrates on his suffering and how much attainable but transient happiness he has lost, it’s not surprising that he would feel burned through the transformation. The most important thing is, don’t forget your “why” and your higher vision of what you want to achieve. 

* If you want to obtain certain things, you need to attract them instead of chasing after them. Think about what kind of person you need to become to possess what you want. <br/><br/>

Finally, in both books, the authors use exponential models to describe the effect of small changes over time. At first glance, it makes sense as typically, once you’re at certain places, you’ll obtain more resources that should accelerate the process. Though I still wonder if everything follows this rule. For example, you can’t lose 100lbs if you keep eating a low-calorie diet since your body would adjust to it, which means the underlying mathematic model is dynamic. Thus, in my own opinion, the authors simplify a lot of problems. Though I have to admit, for the majority scenarios, just by applying the authors’ rules can already get us pretty far. If you have any feedback or opinions on this question, don’t hesitate to reach out to me so we can have a discussion. :)
