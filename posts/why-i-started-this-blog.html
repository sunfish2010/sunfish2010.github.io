            <p>There, you might be curious, why on earth does a person who works as a software engineer want to start a blog, and the blog isn’t really about tech. Well, thank you for being curious and wanting to know a bit more about me. I hope I can provide you the answer in this post. If you can find some information useful in this post, that’s even better. :)</p>

<p>As I grow older, I notice that it’s much harder to fall asleep. Depends on how bad my insomnia goes, the consequence could either be a reduced efficiency during work, accidentally hurting myself due to lack of focus, or increased heart rate and pain around the chest area.</p>

<p>To save myself from the above-mentioned issues, I began a series of experiments on how to improve my sleep quality. Here are the several things that I found that would help reduce the likelihood of insomnia, with increasing importance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No talking at least 30 mins before bed, as talking seems to make the brain fairly excited and it would take a while for everything to quiet down.</li>
  <li>Keep the body temperature cool.</li>
  <li>Elimination of blue light exposure at least 30 mins before bed, as blue light prevent the body from releasing melatonin, which is a hormone that helps the body get sleepy.</li>
  <li>Finally, quiet the mind.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, the most important rule is also the hardest for me, as my mind is like a machine working 24/7, constantly filled with random thoughts and doesn’t seem that it wants to quiet down. But it is also what motivates me to start this blog. Through practice, I’ve identified the following approaches that work the best for me :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Meditation. To me meditation could mean exercising, drawing or anything that would allow me to devote 100% focus to what’s happening in the current moment.</li>
  <li>Conversations with others. Through the talking process, I can usually connect the dots and arrive at a conclusion so I no longer need to think about the problem.</li>
  <li>Writing down the thoughts. Similar to the previous point, simply jotting down all my ideas help me quiet my brain since it no longer needs to worry about memorizing those issues. What’s better, writing also tends to help me organize my thoughts so that I could look at things from further away.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a very long time, most of  those ideas just remain in my head or my notebook because I thought they had little value. However, as I got to talk with my friends and family more on a deeper level after pandemic started, I realized that my thoughts could actually be valuable for others. Even though they might not necessarily all be well developed, if they only reside within my brain then they definitely contain the least value. Plus, writing a blog post once in a while and publishing it is probably one of the best ways to work toward my tendency of perfectionism. Not to mention all the other benefits like strengthening my critical thinking and improving my writing skills in English as a non-native speaker. In the end, if none of the above end up happening, I hope to use this blog as a way to motivate myself to write down my thoughts, so that years later I could look back and tell myself: “See, you’ve grown so much.”</p>
