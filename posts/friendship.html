          <div class="article-content">
            <p>One thing that I’ve constantly heard from my friends is how much harder it has become to expand social circles after college. While I personally do not have a burning desire to meet new people, as I’m lucky enough to have some college friends who also ended up working in the Bay Area, I do wonder a lot why it seems extremely rare to form meaningful connections with people I meet outside school.</p>

<p>So here are the four reasons that I recapitulated after discussions with friends and my own contemplation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A school provides people a safer environment, a shared identity, and opportunities to bond with others through shared activities.</strong>  <br /> <br />
In school, the bonding process begins even before the first day of instruction. From my personal experience, on the day of orientation when all freshmen gathered together and sung “Hail to the Orange”, a sense of belonging stemmed. People tend to be more friendly to whom they identify as the same group because of a shared sense of “winning” and “losing”. Besides, there are numerous opportunities for people to collaborate and work toward the same goal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>People tend to have a higher need to meet new people in a new environment.</strong>  <br /> <br />
I had two opportunities to observe people’s patterns for making friends in school, one in college, and one in grad school. During these two processes, I noticed how people’s list of close friends often settles within the first few months. It is not surprising that people have a peaking urge to make new friends in a completely new environment since we are social animals. When both parties have a greater interest in forming a connection, the likelihood of it happening will be higher. However, as the number of friends we have increases, our desire to make new friends decreases. After all, we only have limited time, and there could be risks associated with meeting new people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The people we meet in college are more likely to share similar interests and values with us.</strong>  <br /> <br />
People we hang out most frequently in college are probably classmates and buddies from the same special interest groups. With similar age, shared major, and shared interests, the likelihood that we can find someone with shared values are higher.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>People become busier after college, and we often hold more responsibilities and obligations.</strong>  <br /> <br />
As we grow up older, there are more things we need to worry about in general: work, financial conditions, relationships, family members, etc.  With less time, people are more selective about who they spend their time with. Not to mention all the responsibilities one would have after getting married and having kids.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The above four bullet points are relatively straightforward, and I believe most people can figure them out. However, what matters is not the “why” but how we can make it less challenging and apply what we learn to strengthen existing friendships.</p>

<p>To me, trust is essential in maintaining meaningful relationships. And we can cultivate trust through shared experiences, open communications, and mutual kindness. Interestingly, I found that people don’t necessarily need to do certain activities together at the same time to bond. What matters more is having been through similar difficult experiences and finding people who can understand our struggles and show empathy. Therefore, the capability and willingness to be vulnerable are crucial in forming deep connections.</p>

<p>Time is another concern for me since I would be blessed to have 1-2 hours left per day after accomplishing my own goals. Thus, coming up with an efficient and flexible plan to connect with my friends becomes necessary. The solution that I resolve to is writing emails with my friends. I’ve been writing emails with strangers from around the world and have had some positive experiences, so why don’t I just spend those time strengthening existing friendships? Emails have the mysterious power of letting people be vulnerable. What’s better, its asynchronicity takes the pressure of replying off both sides, creating more flexibility.</p>

<p>So far, I’ve only written 4 letters with my friends, but I cannot describe how joyful I was when I received my friends’ responses. It is definitely among the best decisions I have made in 2020, and I hope you’ll be able to find something that works for you to deepen your relationships.</p>
