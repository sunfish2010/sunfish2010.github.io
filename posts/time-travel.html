            <p>Now, if I tell you I can time travel. You will probably be thinking that I must be crazy. What if I tell you that you can also time travel. In fact, every one of us is probably consciously or unconsciously doing it many times a day.</p>

<p>Consider the Facebook memory functionality whereas it brings a photo uploaded from many years ago and takes you back to the time of when the photo was taken? If you close your eyes and imagine yourself to be in that moment and gradually add more details, what do you see and what do you feel?</p>

<p>I find it odd and amazing when I realize how many tiny details my brain is capable of capturing, the overly bright sun, my soft and warm scarf, the chill wind blowing from the bay, there was I, facing Jersey city and standing in the overly crowded Rockefeller Park. It was still the good old day when no one needs to wear a mask in public places.</p>

<p>However, are our brains really reliable? It was really shocking for me when I first heard that our brains activate the exact same region when we are recalling memories and projecting into futures. Of course, this allows us to make the connections between past and future so we can recognize patterns and learn from our pasts. At the same time, it shows how our grasp of reality is most likely subjective and not so trustworthy.</p>

<p>What’s special about modern societies though, is that we have so much redundancy in information thanks to the digital revolution. The increasing accessibility of cheap chips for large storage space enables us to capture our lives much more easily and frequently than ever before. People are taking pictures, recordings, and vlogging everywhere they go. The question is, how often do we visit them once they’re all saved or backed up in the cloud? And what kind of content are we saving? Are the things we share on social media a real representative of ourselves?</p>

<p>I remember when I was a teenager when there were no smartphones and the capacity of inbox text messages was limited at 100. I needed to constantly review the messages and decided which ones to keep and which ones to delete. Until I ran out of space, I wrote them down on paper before deleting them. Now I rarely check my phone since it’s full of junk messages from delivery services and payment reminders. Same for the photos, ever since I turned on auto-sync for google photo, I no longer bother to take a second look at my photos to decide which ones to keep. Instead, I just delete all of them at once. And what I lose is the opportunity to look back and have a conversation with the me weeks, months, or even years ago. Strangely enough, without looking into the past and talking to my past self, I quickly forget the majority of my thoughts, feelings, whether positive or negative. And during that process, time just slips through my hand and I simply grow older unconsciously, potentially repeating the same mistakes, and running away from opportunities as fear clouds my judgments.</p>

<p>So, technology brings convenience. But is convenience all that I want? What can I do to make it work for me instead of against me?</p>

<p>To me, the trick might lie in conscious selections and constant revisits. Among the overwhelming amount of information available to me, I need to mindfully select which ones are useful for me. And that is when a useful searching algorithm comes into play. Whether it is the ability to search by date, word, format, or even pattern, graph, words in graphs, etc. A good searching mechanism helps me find out important information so I can put them into a separate collection that is easier for me to come back later. Another thing is to prune content on a regular basis instead of hoarding everything like a squirrel (interestingly in a lovely way squirrels can often forget where they hide their food).</p>

<p>All these might just be effort-taking and time-wasting to you, but I can’t really say how much I have benefited from time traveling to the past and having the conversations with my past self. It reminds me to be more grateful, cheerful, resilient, and most importantly, enjoy the present.</p>

<p>Love and peace &lt;3.</p>
