<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">Title: The Second Mountain [暂无中译]
Author: David Brooks 
Easy to read: ★★★★ 
Recommendation: ★★★☆ 
Good Read: 3.7/5 
豆瓣: 7.8/10 </code></pre></figure>

<p>I read this book back in early March while I was still recovering from the surgery, and I’ve forgotten most of the details. (Shrug)</p>

<p>For the little information I can still remember, this book covers what it means to live a meaningful life. The author describes life as climbing two mountains, whereas on the first mountain, people seek what our culture admires: success, fame, happiness. But often, when people get to the top, they find it unsatisfying and realize that another mountain is out there to climb. The second mountain, as the author describes, is a mountain that shifts people’s focus from self-centered to other-centered. The author then describes the four commitments that define a life of meaning and purpose.</p>

<p>I enjoy this book as it is quite thought-provoking that it helps me redefine the essential things in my life. And I was quite surprised when I noticed how much of an advocate the author is toward building supportive communities. I came to the United States about seven years ago for college. A big culture shock to me at the time was a lack of belonging. Yes, there were small groups that one can join to make friends and find support from. However, if you see each group as a dot, there are many dots on campus, most are weakly connected. People value privacy, free will, and independence, which is not a bad thing. However, human beings are not solitary. We need social interactions and support from other individuals. I believe we all recognize this fact during the quarantine. This is why I appreciate the author when he mentions interdependence.</p>

<p>However, in my opinion, the author is somewhat too idealistic. There is nothing in the world that doesn’t come with a price tag. What usually comes with support from a community is a loss of privacy and diversity. It is tricky to design a community that can prosper in the long term. If you’re interested in learning more about this topic, I’d recommend you take a look at the next book.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">Title: Blueprint - The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society [蓝图 - 好社会的八大特征]
Author: Nicholas A. Christakis
Easy to read：★★★ 
Recommendation：★★★☆ 
Good Read: 4/5 
豆瓣: 7.2/10 </code></pre></figure>

<p>In this book, the author argues how our genes shape the way we form societies, which in return shapes our genes as a feedback loop. I find this book an appealing read because it talks about societies formed during extreme scenarios like shipwrecks, online gaming communities put up together by design, utopian communities, communities created by other animals, etc. And I enjoy learning random facts about distinct cultures, what they share in common, and what makes them unique. Though I have to admit that this book does feel like a textbook, and I almost gave up because it spends too many efforts describing shipwrecks.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">Title: How to Win Friends and Influence People [人性的弱点]
Author: Dale Carnegie
Easy to read：★★★★★ 
Recommendation：★★★★☆
Good Read: 4.2/5 
豆瓣: 8.0/10 </code></pre></figure>

<p>I have a pretty mixed feeling about this book. On the one hand, it is the first book that inspires me to look at things from an off-centered perspective, and I believe there are a tremendous amount of values in doing so. On the other hand, it is hard not to see this book as a book to teach people how to manipulate others, as the author describes human beings as foolish and incapable of self-reflection. I understand that this book was first published in the 90s, so it has its limitation. Not to mention that sometimes it’s tricky to define what is “manipulative” if a win-win situation can be achieved in the end. Nevertheless, I still believe this is a book worth reading. So my suggestion is to take what resonates and be careful with the intentions when applying the rules.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">Title: What Life Could Mean to You [自卑与超越]
Author: Alfred Adler
Easy to read：★★★★★ 
Recommendation：★★★☆
Good Read: 4.1/5 
豆瓣: 8.0/10 </code></pre></figure>

<p>A book that helps me understand how the environment shaped our personalities during childhood and how we might still be influenced by our past experiences even after we grew up. The pains we experienced during childhood might feel intense and overwhelming because as a child, we only have limited power. However, we shall not dwell in those experiences because we have become stronger, though we might not realize it. It is beautiful how each experience helps transform and shape us into whoever we are today, so don’t let your past define who you are. I take off one star because a) this book is a little out-dated. b) I was reading the Chinese version, and the translation is pretty terrible.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">Title: Roar: How to Match Your Food and Fitness to Your Unique Female Physiology for Optimum Performance, Great Health, and a Strong, Lean Body for Life [暂无中译]
Author: Stacy T. Sims
Easy to read：★★★★★ 
Recommendation：★★☆
Good Read: 4.1/5 
豆瓣: N/A </code></pre></figure>

<p>A book that I bought to help me understand how to improve my performance and what I need to pay attention to while training as a female. Overall, the book backs up my hypothesis on how my performance is correlated with hormones and menstrual cycles, and how specific diet and exercise plans are not ideal for women. However, I don’t think I can benefit much from the book since I’m not in competitions. What’s more, this book falls short on providing scientific experiments and citations, which is, unfortunately, the case for most “fitness” books out there.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">Title: Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life [非暴力沟通]
Author: Marshall B. Rosenberg
Easy to read：★★★★★ 
Recommendation：★★★★★
Good Read: 4.4/5 
豆瓣: 8.4/10</code></pre></figure>

<p>I would recommend this book to any individual who wants to improve their communication skills with others, especially loved ones. I figured out many things mentioned by the author in the tough way. For example, when we hear accusations from others, instead of letting our defense mechanism control us, we shall think from the other person’s perspective and find the motivations behind it. Or, when we feel sad or disappointed, instead of pointing fingers, we should express our feelings, describe the facts, and ask clarifying questions. This book will not turn you into a communication expert overnight since making real changes takes time and practices, but it shall at least help you increase awareness.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">Title: Boundaries [过犹不及:如何建立你的心理界线]
Author: Henry Cloud, John Townsend
Easy to read：★★★★★ 
Recommendation：★★★★
Good Read: 4.2/5 
豆瓣: 8.2/10</code></pre></figure>

<p>If you have ever wondered why “nice” people always finish last, this might be the book for you. For a long time, I struggled to say “no” to others, especially those I care about. This tendency to be overly “altruistic” led to unhealthy boundaries, which created resentment in the end. This book helps me identify the fear behind my actions and better understand love(in the general sense). One thing to notice is that this book explains a lot of concepts from a Christian perspective. If you’re not religious, simply ignore those parts. The lessons should be universal nevertheless.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">Title: Atomic Habits: An Easy &amp; Proven Way to Build Good Habits &amp; Break Bad Ones [掌控习惯 : 如何养成好习惯并戒除坏习惯]
Author: James Clear
Easy to read：★★★★★ 
Recommendation：★★★★
Good Read: 4.3/5 
豆瓣: 8.6/10</code></pre></figure>

<p>A book that offers readers a practical framework for making positive changes. The secret of creating a habit is straightforward: make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, and make it satisfying. And if you want to quit something, do the opposite. My favorite part for the book is ironically in the appendix, and it’s only three pages long (Little Lessons from the Four Laws). I’ll include several quotes here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is the idea of pleasure that we chase. <br /><br />
Peace occurs when you don’t turn your observations into problems. <br /><br />
Craving is about wanting to fix everything. Observation without craving is the realization that you do not need to fix anything. <br /><br />
With big enough why you can overcome any how.</p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">Title: The Compound Effect: Jumpstart Your Income, Your Life, Your Success [暂无中译]
Author: Darren Hardy
Easy to read：★★★★★ 
Recommendation：★★★★
Good Read: 4.4/5 
豆瓣: 7.3/10</code></pre></figure>

<p>The Compound Effect is another book on goal achieving and making meaningful transformations. Some theories in Atomic Habits are piggybacked on this book (as seen from the reference). For some reason, this book left me a deeper impression even though it’s less popular. For a more detailed review of this book, see <a href="https://sunfish2010.github.io/posts/the-compound-effect">here</a>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">Title: How do you live? [你想活出怎样的人生]
Author: Yoshino Genzaburo [吉野源三郎]
Easy to read：★★★★★ 
Recommendation：★★★★★
Good Read: N/A
豆瓣: 8.6/10</code></pre></figure>

<p>My favorite book so far for 2020. Simple, powerful, and warm. In my opinion, this is a book suitable for anyone from age 10 to 80, and I wish I could have encountered it in my childhood. And I would read it to my kid if I end up having one in the future. You might need a little bit of understanding about Japanese culture and history to thoroughly grasp the book, but the main ideas behind it are golden and universal.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">Title: Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything [蘋果橘子經濟學] 
Author: Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner 
Easy to read：★★★★★ 
Recommendation：★★★★
Good Read: 4/5
豆瓣: 7.9/10</code></pre></figure>

<p>I was a subscriber to the Freakonomics podcast during college and listened to it on my way to lectures. So when I found out they had published a book, I purchased it in Audible and finished it while doing chores. It taught me several unexpected truths and warned me again to be more careful about correlation and causation.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">Title: 李银河说爱情
Author: 李银河
Easy to read：★★★★★ 
Recommendation：★★★
Good Read: N/A
豆瓣: 8.1/10</code></pre></figure>

<p>A book written in spoken language as the content was created for podcasts. I appreciate how open-minded and how candid the author is, and she helps me rethink what love is and what love means in modern days. It’s quite stunning to see how marriage, love, relationship, and sex have changed through history and how people in distinctive cultures view them.</p>
