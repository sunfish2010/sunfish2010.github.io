            <p>Hi there, you might be curious, why on earth does a person who works as a software engineer want to start a blog, and the blog isn’t really about tech. Well, thank you for being curious and wanting to know a bit more about me. I hope this post can provide you the answer. If you find some information useful in this post, that’s even better. :)</p>

<p>The idea about creating something seeded in my heart senior year of high school when I realized that I had not produced much value to the world while apparently, I had consumed tons of resources growing to my age. At the time, I chose to take on some part-time jobs to provide service to others. This is also how I earned my first real money from somebody other than my parents. However, my parents were never quite supportive of me taking jobs that anybody can do because they believe my time is more valuable, so I should always put studying as the top priority. I mostly agreed with their proposition. Therefore, even though I continued to work part-time during college, I was quite selective about what job I should take. And my focus remained on getting my bachelor’s degree. Then I went to grad school. Grad school was crazy, which left me with absolutely no time for any part-time job. Now I am finally working as most adults out there, living a nine-to-five lifestyle. As a software engineer, I am more privileged as I earn a decent amount of salary. However, there is one question that I keep asking myself, is the work I am doing every day worth the money I am earning? Of course, I know my salary is a compound result of market supply, demand, and values I can provide. And I know that hard work deserves equivalent payback. Still, I just cannot quench the voice inside me.</p>

<p>Another thing I notice as I grow older is how much harder it is for me to fall asleep nowadays. Depends on how bad my insomnia goes, the consequence could be a reduced efficiency during work, accidentally hurting myself due to lack of focus, or a lack of energy and pain in the body.</p>

<p>To save myself from the issues mentioned above, I began a series of experiments on how to improve my sleep quality. Here are the several things that I found to help reduce the likelihood of insomnia, with increasing importance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No talking at least 30 mins before bed, as talking seems to make the brain somewhat excited and it would take a while for everything to quiet down.</li>
  <li>Keep the body temperature cool.</li>
  <li>Elimination of blue light exposure at least 30 mins before bed, as blue light prevents the body from releasing melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep cycle.</li>
  <li>Finally, quiet the mind.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, the most important rule is also the hardest for me, as my mind is like a machine working 24/7, always filled with random thoughts and doesn’t seem that it wants to quiet down. But through practice, I’ve identified the following approaches that work the best for me :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Meditation. To me, meditation could mean exercising, drawing or anything that would allow me to devote 100% focus to what’s happening in the current moment.</li>
  <li>Conversations with others. Through the talking process, I can usually connect the dots and solidify my ideas so that I no longer need to think about the problem.</li>
  <li>Writing down the thoughts. Similar to the previous point, simply jotting down all my ideas helps me quiet my brain since it no longer needs to worry about memorizing those issues. What’s better, writing helps me organize my thoughts and look at things at a higher level.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a very long time, most of those ideas remain in my head or my notebook because I thought they had little value. What’s more, I was concerned about sharing thoughts publicly as I am always afraid to offend people unconsciously. However, as I happened to have more profound conversations with friends and family members after the pandemic started, I realized that my thoughts could be valuable for others. Many encouraged me to share as even my ideas might not be well developed; they contain the least value if they only reside within my brain. So I thought this might be the call for me to start writing something and sharing with others. Through sharing my thoughts, I hope more people can reach back to me for discussions, which would be the best opportunity for me to learn. Plus, writing would force me to absorb valuable content and condense them into my own words, which would push me for constant growth. Worst case scenario, it is always meaningful to keep a record of ideas and experiences so that years later, I could look back and tell myself: “See, you’ve grown so much.” :)</p>
